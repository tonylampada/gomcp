**Subject**: Claude.ai Remote MCP Server Integration - Connect Button Not Working Despite Successful OAuth

---

Dear Anthropic Support Team,

I am writing to report a technical issue with Claude.ai's remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that appears to be on the Claude.ai client side rather than our server implementation.

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: The "Connect" button in Claude.ai's MCP integration interface remains stuck on "Connect" instead of changing to "Connected", despite successful OAuth authentication and technically correct server implementation.

**Server URL**: https://mcp.evolutio.io  
**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/tonylampada/gomcp

## Technical Details

### ✅ What Works Perfectly
1. **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Complete success every time
   - GitHub OAuth integration functional
   - Token exchange working correctly
   - User receives "connection success" toast notification
   - All OAuth endpoints responding correctly

2. **Server Implementation**: Following official specifications
   - FastMCP framework with SSE transport
   - Proper discovery endpoint at root (`/`)
   - OAuth discovery at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
   - Pre-registered Claude.ai client ID: `91be729f-30be-4614-b93f-f2b4a7ec8a98`
   - `claudeai` scope implemented as required
   - Tool discovery allowed without authentication (`required_scopes=[]`)

3. **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Server follows all documented specifications
   - SSE endpoint configured at `/sse`
   - Proper JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol implementation
   - Tool registration working (`get_user_profile` tool available)
   - Root discovery endpoint returns correct MCP transport information

### ❌ What Fails
**MCP Session Establishment**: After successful OAuth, Claude.ai fails to establish MCP session:

1. Claude.ai completes OAuth flow successfully
2. Hits root endpoint and gets proper discovery information
3. **Sometimes** connects to SSE endpoint (`/sse`) but immediately hangs
4. **Sometimes** doesn't attempt SSE connection at all  
5. Never proceeds to MCP protocol requests (initialize, tools/list)
6. Connect button never changes to "Connected" status
7. No tools are discovered or made available

### Log Evidence
Our server logs show the complete OAuth success pattern:
```
GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server → 200 OK
GET /authorize → 302 Found (GitHub redirect)  
GET /github/callback → 302 Found (back to Claude.ai)
POST /token → 200 OK (token exchange)
GET / → 200 OK (discovery)
```

But then either:
- No SSE connection attempt, OR
- `GET /sse → 200 OK` (connects but hangs with no subsequent MCP requests)

## Research and Investigation

We have conducted extensive research and debugging:

### Similar Issues Found
- **GitHub Issue**: [SSE Infinite Hang](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1663) - Similar hanging behavior
- **Stack Overflow**: [SSE Connection Not Established](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79582846/the-python-mcp-server-with-stdio-transport-throws-an-error-sse-connection-not) - Related SSE issues
- **Community Reports**: Multiple reports of remote MCP connection failures

### Working Examples Analysis
Most documented successful MCP implementations are for:
- **Claude Desktop** (local app) - Well documented and functional
- **Enterprise Solutions** (Atlassian, Azure, Cloudflare) - Potentially with access to undocumented specifications

### Technical Hypothesis
Based on our investigation, this appears to be:
1. **Claude.ai Remote MCP Beta Limitations**: The web interface integration may have undocumented requirements
2. **SSE Handshake Mismatch**: Claude.ai may expect specific initial SSE events not documented in public MCP specifications
3. **Enterprise vs Individual Server Differences**: Major company implementations work, suggesting possible API access differences

## Complete Documentation
Full technical analysis and debugging process available at:
- **Progress Documentation**: [MCP_TOOLS_PROGRESS.md](https://github.com/tonylampada/gomcp/blob/master/MCP_TOOLS_PROGRESS.md)
- **Server Implementation**: [server.py](https://github.com/tonylampada/gomcp/blob/master/mcp_simple_auth/server.py)

## Questions for Anthropic Support

1. **Are there undocumented requirements** for Claude.ai remote MCP servers beyond the published specifications?

2. **Is this a known issue** with the beta remote MCP integration in Claude.ai?

3. **Are there additional authentication or session establishment steps** required for remote servers that are not documented?

4. **Do remote MCP servers need specific SSE handshake patterns** that differ from the documented MCP SSE specification?

5. **Is there more detailed documentation** available for Claude.ai remote MCP integration beyond the current help articles?

## Server Details for Testing
- **URL**: https://mcp.evolutio.io
- **Transport**: SSE with OAuth 2.0
- **OAuth Provider**: GitHub
- **Available for Testing**: Server is live and responding correctly to all documented MCP protocol requirements

## Request
Given that our implementation follows all documented MCP specifications correctly and OAuth works perfectly, we believe this issue is on the Claude.ai client side. We would appreciate:

1. Investigation into Claude.ai's remote MCP session establishment process
2. Access to additional technical documentation if available
3. Confirmation of any undocumented requirements for remote MCP servers
4. Updates on the beta status and known limitations of remote MCP integration

Thank you for your time and assistance. We're happy to provide additional technical details, logs, or testing access as needed.

Best regards,
